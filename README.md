#Learn Python

This repository is dedicated to working through the exercises associated with two introductory resources, 'Think Python' and 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. For more information on these books, check out the resource review section of my blog â€“

### Think Python

Consisting of around 18 python scripts, I work through each of the chapters as they're being explained. Think Python is, in my opinion, the better of the two introductory resources. The book provides a straight forward explanation and corresponding examples to each of the fundamental concepts.

### Learn Python the Hard Way

Heavy on rote memorization and application, this folder contains around 50 python scripts associated with Learn Python the Hard Way. There are more than 50 chapters in the book, but I decided to leave out the object-oriented programming and instead jump into NumPy and SciPy.
